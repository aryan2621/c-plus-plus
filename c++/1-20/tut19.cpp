// oops was the conecpt that is reason to support oops in c++;
// classes are the concept that is added to make it related to real world
// as size increase the debuging helps decrease
// data security get decrease and get compromised
// and that is why the concept is there.
// works on concept of classes and objects
// a class is a template to create objects
// treats as critical elements
// decompose problem in objects and build data and functions around them.

// procedural orented programming

// consist of writing a set of instructions for the computer to follow
// main focus is on the functions and not in the flow of data
// data moves from functions to functions
// functions either use the local or global variables


// data abstraction -> wrapping data and function in single unit
// inhertance -> passing of qualities
// polymorphism-> ability of having many forms.
// dynamic binding -> code who not runs unit programs not run.
// message passing-> object.message call format.

// benefits ->
// code reusalibity // data hidng  // multiple objects // complexity easily managed.
