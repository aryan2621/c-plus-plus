// containers in stl->

// stl= containers + algo+ iterators
//(object to store data)+(procedure to process data) +(object which points to an elment of a container)

// container-> sequence container-> store the data in linear fashion.(vector,dequeue,list)
//          ->associative container-> direct access.(set,map,multiset,multimap)
//          -> derived container-> real world modeling.(stack,queue,priority queue)

// when to use which?

// vector -> random access fast ,insertion/deletion in middle slow,insertion/deletion at end fast.
// list -> random access fast slow,insertion at middle is fast,insertion at end is fast.
// associative containers -> all operations are fast except random access.
// derive containers -> depends
